# Node ESBuild Caxa Starter

This is a starter boilerplate for packaging a `.exe` Node.js with esbuild and caxa.

## Installation

```pwsh
pnpm install
```

## Usage

```pwsh
pnpm build && pnpm package
```

> [!NOTE]
> Caxa is deprecated, but there is no other viable packaging solution working with ESM modules
